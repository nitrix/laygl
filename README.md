## Learn OpenGL (learngl)

Just a simple project while I'm learning OpenGL.

### Currently implemented

- Creating a window and renderer with a modern OpenGL context.
- High resolution clock for elapsed-time calculation.
- Support .obj file format.
- Phong lighting (ambient + diffuse + specular).
- Materials (ambient + diffuse + specular + shininess).
- Back-face culling optimization.
- Wireframe toggleable mode.

### Short term

- Entities with a model, texture, position, rotation and scale.
- Third person camera with tilt-pan-zoom offsets.

### Long term

- Flat terrain.
- Transparency
- Fog
- Multi-texturing
- Mipmapping
- Terrain collision
- Texture atlases
- GUI
- Multiple lights
- Point lights
- Day/night cycle
- Cell shading
- Normal mapping
- Font rendering
- Distance field text rendering
- Particle effects
- Instanced rendering
- Procedural terrain
- Shadow mapping
- Percentage closer filtering
- Antialiasing and anisotropic filtering
- Post-processing effects
- Gaussian Blur
- Multisampled FBOs
- Specular maps
- Bloom effect
- Multiple render targets
- Geometry shaders
- Cube map reflections
- Render to cube map texture
- Skeletal animation
- Lens flare
- Occlusion queries
- Water

### Unsure

- Material emission.
- Batch rendering using some kind of scene manager.
- Runtime keybinding system to map actions to GLFW key constants.
- Associating different materials to different mesh parts of a model.
- Loading materials from files.
